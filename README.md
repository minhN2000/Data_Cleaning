## Co-op Experience 
---
**Data Science Intern** 						
*Losant IoT* May 2022 - August 2022
+ Provided examples and cheat sheet of exploratory data analysis in time series data for IoT customers
+ Provided anomaly detection solutions for a customer using Isolation Forest. Provided a workflow to automatically re-train the model by calculating Precision and Recall values from labeled datasets, and deciding the next step
+ Provided time series forecasting solution for a set of customers using LSTM predicting 800 records for 7 days ahead using past 100,000 records. Maximized the forecasting using Change Point Detection to determine breaking points when the data is no longer stationary

**Researcher**
*University of Cincinnati* May2021 - August 2021
+ Collect Android-apps bug reports those have reproducing steps and images.
+ Research on natural language to images conversion to convert Android-apps bug reports’ texts to a page and image retrieval to retrieve bug reports’ images from a set of all page images the apps have
+ Implemented Autoencoders model with 19 layers for content-based image retrieval
