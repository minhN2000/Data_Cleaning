## Co-op Experience 
---
**Machine Learning Engineer Intern in Bioinformatic**
*Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center* December 2022 - Present
+ In progress

**Researcher**
*University of Cincinnati - EECE Department* May2021 - Present
+ Research on context-based image retrieval (CBIR) by applying CNN ResNet, self-built Autoencoders, and SIFT.
Applied Data Augmentation technique which artificially expands the dataset to reduce overfitting, and utilized
Ensemble Learning with three models which improve accuracy from 86% to 91% using TensorFlow.
+ Collect bug reports from Android apps and manually reproduce them using Android Studio and MonkeyRunner.
+ Test and compare the CBIR models on ~133 Android apps/ test cases, and there are 127 apps showing that the
model can retrieve the correct pages that match the query images.

**Teaching Assistant**
*University of Cincinnati - EECE Department* May2021 - Decemberr 2022
+ Cooperated with a Professor and other Teaching Assistants to help/support first-year students with fundamental
programming concepts in C++ such as syntax, data types, vector, pointer, and object-oriented programming.
+ Tailored advice to meet groups of students’ demands and problems during project assignments, ensuring high-
value and productive learning and working experience.
+ Graded ~100 students’ weekly assignments. Used the “Measure of Software Similarity” system to detect cheating.

**Data Science Intern**
*Losant IoT* May2022 - September 2022
+ Implemented anomaly detection solutions for a customer using Isolation Forest and one-class SVM.
+ Executed time series forecasting solution using ARIMA or XGBoost models. Maximized the
forecasting using Change Point Detection to determine breaking points when the data is no longer stationary.

**Researcher**
*University of Cincinnati - High-Performance Computing Lab* May2021 - September 2021
+ Studied Persistent Homology and used it to extract topological features from multiple datasets.
+ Implemented a function to compute intersection from a set of polytopes using GJK Algorithm and Convex Hulls.
+ Learned Machine Learning programming skills and projected features using t-SNE, UMAP, PCA, and Heatmap.
